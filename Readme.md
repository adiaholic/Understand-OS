# Understand OS

This repository contains a collection of small projects exploring low-level systems programming concepts.

## Projects

* [`memory_access_timing_exp/`](./memory_access_timing_exp/):
  Measure memory access times across CPU registers, caches, and RAM.

* [`inspect_registers/`](./inspect_registers/):
  Read and flush CPU registers on ARM64; observe system constraints and behavior.

* [`hard_links/`](./hard_links/):
  Trace and analyze system calls (`linkat`, `unlinkat`, `openat`) involved in creating, deleting, and reading hard links.
